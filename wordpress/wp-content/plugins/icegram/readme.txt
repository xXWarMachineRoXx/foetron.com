2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Click on 'Icegram' option within WordPress admin sidebar menu

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Messages look broken / formatting is weird... =

This is most likely due to CSS conflicts with the current theme. We suggest using simple formatting for messages. You can also write custom CSS in your theme to fix any problems.

= Extra Line Breaks / Paragraphs in messages... =

Go to HTML mode in content editor and pull your custom HTML code all together in one line. Don't leave blank lines between two tags. That should fix it.

= How do I add custom CSS for messages? =

You can use custom CSS/JS inline in your message HTML. You can also use your theme's custom JS / CSS feature to add your changes.

= Optin Forms / Mailing service integration... =

You can embed any opt-in / subscription form to your Icegram messages using HTML code. You may even use a shortcode if you are using a WP plugin from your newsletter/lead capture service.

Use the "Embed Form" button above the text editor to paste in HTML code from your mailing list service and let Icegram automatically "clean it up" for usage in Icegram messages.

= Preview does not work / not refreshing... =

Doing a browser refresh while previewing will not show your most recent changes. Click the 'Preview' button to see a preview with your latest changes.

= Can I use shortcodes in a message? =

Yes! Messages support shortcodes. You may need to adjust CSS so the shortcode output looks good in your message.

= I can't find a way to do X... =

Icegram is actively developed. If you can't find your favorite feature (or have a suggestion) contact us. We'd love to hear from you.
